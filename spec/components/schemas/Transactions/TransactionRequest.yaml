      The type of transaction requested. 
      You should always include the type within your API request.
      This supports a limited subset of Transaction types.  To refund or void, use the refund endpoint.
      To `capture` use the `sale` endpoint.  It will capture if there are any eligible
      transactions of type `authorize` that can be captured.
    type: string
    enum:
      - sale
      - authorize
      - credit
  amount:
    description: |
      The transaction amount.  Use `0` for a zero dollar verification. This is important if 
      you want to authorize a payment instrument before giving access to a free trial, for example.

  invoiceIds:
    description: |
      The array of invoice identifiers.  It's important to note that the transaction
      amount can be more or less than the combined invoice amounts.  If the transaction
      is a type `sale` and it is `approved` it will be applied to these invoices in
      the order of the first issued invoice to the most recently issued invoice.  If
      there are enough funds to fully pay an invoice, the invoice status will be marked
      as paid.
