  - Issue invoice immediately when the service period _starts_ and bill it immediately
  - Issue invoice immediately when the service period _starts_ and bill it after _interval of time_
  - Issue invoice _interval of time_ before the service period _starts_ and bill it after _interval of time_
  - Issue invoice _interval of time_ after the service period _starts_ and bill it after _interval of time_
