      The price formula determines what algorithm is used to calculate the invoice price based on a few factors,
      - the quantity in the subscription (which may be variable if usage pricing, otherwise determined when creating the subscription)
      - the price brackets data

      To determine which formula is correct, please see the price formula documentation.
