    Additionally, a file can be sent with:
     - multipart/form-data POST request: in this case all property names are the same as the JSON ones (`file` is an uploaded file)
     - file body request: the file body is sent as the request body, with the appropriate `Content-Type`. No aditional
     properties can be set along the request data

    The following file types only are allowed:
     - jpg
     - png
     - gif
     - pdf
     - mp3


    If using a Publishable Api Key, only private files can be created. The files can later on be modified or used using
     a secret API key.
