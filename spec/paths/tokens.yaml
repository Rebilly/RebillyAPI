  summary: Create a payment token

    is the recommended way to 
    create a payment token because it minimizes
    PCI DSS compliance.  Once a payment token 
    is created, it can only be used once.

    A payment token expires upon first use
    or within 30 minutes of the token creation
    (whichever comes first).

    In the event that you need to expire a token
    for other reasons, you may expire
    a token.
